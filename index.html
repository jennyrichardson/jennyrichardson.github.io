<h1>Jenny Richardson is a <br>Graphic Designer &amp; Illustrator</h1>

<p>Ever since a very young age, I have always had an eye for aesthetics. Growing up I spent a lot of my time admiring all of the art that surrounded me on a daily basis. Whether it was a beautiful painting, or an excellent package design for a product, it excited me and influenced me in many ways.</p>

<p>My passion for art and design gave me the confidence to begin my own creative journey. Once I graduated from high school I decided to take my passion seriously, and I made the decision to study Graphic Design. I am now in my third, and final year of Graphic Design at Algonquin College, working towards receiving my college diploma so that I can take the next step towards my career as a designer and illustrator.</p>

<p>My goal as a designer and an illustrator is to share with the world what originally inspired and excited me. Art is for everyone to enjoy, and if I can take something that is otherwise plain and unappealing and make it aesthetically pleasing to other people, and make them excited about how something looks and makes them feel, then I couldn't ask for more than that.</p>
